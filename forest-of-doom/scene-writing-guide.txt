Describe each “scene” in one page. State the purpose/conflict/tension of the scene. What is required to resolve it to move to the next scene? Setting, cast, plot, (theme?). Provide several ways the tension may be resolved. Provide mechanics (Difficulty Class, Skill Checks, etc.) for any traps or obstacles. Use bullets, bold, italics, etc. to present information efficiently.
