 Ghoti is dyslexic and had her tongue removed by Orcs as a child. She learned Sylvan in the two years she spent as a tongueless dyslexic slug. She has studied the evolution of Elvish from Sylvan. Some people have suggested renaming Sylvan to Olde Elvish based on her research. Ghoti curates the Ox-Fur Elvish Dictionary (OED). Her path through life is so improbable that you couldnâ€™t possibly make it up.
