<p>Disguised and deadly, Sissy springs a trap—will the heroes unravel her deception or succumb to her chilling curse?</p>
<h3>Story Information</h3>
<p>Following Bigleg's clue, the heroes seek Yaztromo, only to be intercepted by Sissy, the malevolent <span class="monster">green hag</span>. Disguised as Boomer the courier <span class="monster">centaur</span>, she attempts to thwart them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Centaur Figure: The central subject is a centaur with a somewhat weathered appearance. He has a long, flowing white beard, a muscular torso with visible tattoos, and is wearing a red beret. A pair of spectacles sits perched on his nose, and a slight paunch hints at a fondness for good food. A gap-toothed smile suggests a life filled with laughter and perhaps a few too many adventures.</li>
<li>Horse Features: The lower body is that of a brown horse with a powerful build and a flowing mane.</li>
<li>Attire: The centaur is wearing a belt with pouches and carries a spear slung over his shoulder. He also has saddlebags full of correspondence that he is delivering.</li>

</ul>
<figure>

<figcaption>Sissy disguised as Boomer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Failing that, she changes her disguise into the <span class="monster">dryad</span> Bloodmoon.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Bizarre Hybrid: The creature is a strange combination of horse, woman, and tree. It has the powerful hindquarters and legs of a stallion, cloaked in dark, almost leathery hide.</li>
<li>Upper Body Transformation: The upper body is more humanoid, with elongated features, skin like bark, and branches sprouting from its shoulders and head. It's as if the creature is merging with the surrounding trees.</li>
<li>Unnatural Grace: The creature moves with an unnatural grace, its hooves barely touching the ground as it advances.</li>
<li>Expressive Face: Its face is a mask of contradictions - wild, knowing eyes, a sly smile, and yet something ancient and unsettling lurks beneath the surface.</li>
<li>Shifting Form: The creature's form seems to be in flux, flickering and shifting before your eyes.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="02a-transformation.jpeg" class="storyboard"/>
<figcaption>Sissy transforms from Boomer to Bloodmoon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Her illusory transformation complete, in the guise of Bloodmoon, she curses the heroes with her chilling magic.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Majestic Figure: The creature stands before you, tall and imposing. Her skin is a mottled green, like bark, and leaves seem to sprout from her limbs.</li>
<li>Dark Eyes: Her eyes are an unsettling shade of red, burning with an unnatural intensity.</li>
<li>Tangled Hair: Her hair is a mass of dark, thorny vines that writhe and twist like living things.</li>
<li>Open Arms: She stands with her arms outstretched, palms facing upwards, as if offering a blessing. However, the gesture feels strangely menacing.</li>
<li>Red Glow: A faint red aura seems to emanate from her, casting an eerie glow on the surrounding trees.</li>

<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>The scene is optional.</li>
<li>If you want to skip the curse, the players can be discouraged by the actual Boomer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reduce each character's primary attribute by 2.</li>

<h4>Player Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Offend Boomer. Eventually Boomer should appear to become frustrated, prompting Sissy to change her disguise to that of Bloodmoon. In the guise of Bloodmoon she curses the players for daring to interfere.</li>
<li>Recruit Boomer. He cannot be recuited, he has mail to deliver.</li>
<li>Examine Boomer. If the players accuse Boomer of deception Sissy will change her disguise to Bloodmoon. Note that Sissy wants her Boomer disguise to be discovered because she wants to trick the players into believing that Bloodmoon is the cause of the curse.</li>
<li>Question Boomer. He advises against helping the dwarves, Darkwood Forest is too dangerous, the mission impossible, and the dwarves unworthy.</li>
<li>Hide from Boomer. He will stop and call the players out.</li>

<h4>Conversation</h4>
<p>Sissy will try to convince the party that Sugarplum and Bloodmoon are dangerous. Ideally, she would like them destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hush now, and listen close. The wind... it ain't just air movin' through the trees, you know. It carries whispers, little scraps of stories that the woods have swallowed whole. And some of those stories… well, they ain't fit for polite company."</p>
<p>She leans closer, her milky eyes fixing on each of you in turn, like she's looking for something lost inside your souls. "The fey... they're like a reflection in a cracked mirror. You see yourself, maybe, but it's all twisted and wrong. They offer you what you crave, what you yearn for deep down in the dark places you don't even like to think about. But there's always a hook, a barb hidden in the sweetness."</p>
<p>"Their magic... it's like a spiderweb, all shimmerin' and delicate, but touch it wrong, and you're caught. Stuck fast. And the more you struggle, the tighter it binds."</p>
<p>She lets out a dry, rattling chuckle that sounds like something breaking. "And their gifts? Don't even get me started on their gifts. They're like apples from a dead tree, all shiny and temptin' on the outside, but rotten to the core. There's always a price, you see, a debt you didn't even know you owed until it comes callin'. And when the fey come to collect... well, let's just say you don't want to be around when that happens."</p>
<p>Her voice drops to a whisper again, barely audible above the rustling of the wind. "These woods... they remember. They remember everythin'. Every promise, every bargain, every drop of blood spilled on their soil. So tread carefully, adventurers. Some secrets... some secrets are best left buried."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Sugarplum she will say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's one in particular you gotta watch for," Sissy rasps, her gaze now narrowed, those milky eyes seeming to bore right into you. "They call him... Sugarplum. Sweet name, ain't it? Like somethin' you'd find in a candy dish. But don't let that fool ya. Sweetness can rot your teeth just as quick as any poison."</p>
<p>She shifts her weight, "He's all flutter and shimmer, like a sunbeam caught in a spiderweb. Yellow scales, they say, like sunshine turned... wrong. And that grin of his... Gods, that grin. It ain't happiness, not the kind you and I understand. It's somethin' else, somethin'... brittle. Like thin ice over a deep, dark pool."</p>
<p>She taps a gnarled finger against her temple, her milky eyes flickering like candle flames in a draft. "He's got a way of gettin' inside your head, too. Whispers and pretty lights, illusions that play on your deepest desires. He offers you what you think you want, but it's always a twisted bargain, a deal with the devil dressed in sunshine."</p>
<p>She pauses, her breath comin' in ragged gasps, like she's rememberin' somethin' unpleasant. "He loves secrets, you see. Loves to gather 'em up like a magpie collectin' shiny bits of trash. And he ain't afraid to use 'em, twist 'em, turn 'em against you when it suits him. He knows things he shouldn't know, hears things he shouldn't hear. It's like he's got ears in the trees, eyes in the very air you breathe."</p>
<p>She points a clawed finger towards the deeper parts of the forest, where the shadows are thickest. "He's bound to this place, tied to it like a root to the earth. He won't leave these woods, not ever. And that should tell you somethin'. It should tell you everythin'. What keeps him here? What's he protectin'? Or... what's he hidin'?"</p>
<p>She leans in close again, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "So if you see him, this... Sugarplum... with his sweet name and his brittle grin... be careful. Be damn careful. Because the sweetest things can leave the bitterest taste in your mouth. And some bargains... some bargains are best left unmade."
</blockquote>
<p>Of Bloodmoon she will say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now, there's another... a presence, you might say, deep in the heart of this wood," Sissy begins, her voice taking on a hushed, almost reverent tone, like she's speaking of something sacred, or maybe something cursed. "They call her Bloodmoon, though she ain't got nothin' to do with the sky, not really. She's... of the trees, you understand? Born from the roots and the rot, the sap and the sorrow."</p>
<p>She runs a clawed finger along a piece of gnarled wood on the wall, her milky eyes distant, like she's seeing something far away, something lost in the deep time of the forest. "She's old, older than the oldest oaks, older than the stories they whisper in the wind. She remembers when the world was young, when the trees walked and the rivers sang their own songs. But memory... memory can be a dangerous thing. It can cling to you like a shroud, keepin' you from movin' on."</p>
<p>She lets out a sigh, a sound like wind rustlin' through dead leaves. "She loves this forest, that's the truth of it. Loves it like a mother loves her child, maybe even more. But her love... it's a possessive kind of love, a love that chokes and smothers. She don't like change, see? She don't like nothin' new. She wants everythin' to stay the same, locked in the amber of the past."</p>
<p>Her gaze snaps back to the party, sharp and intense. "She sees you as a threat, you know. You and your... comings and goings, your meddlin' ways. She sees you as a disease, somethin' that's come to infect her woods, to disrupt the balance she's worked so hard to maintain."</p>
<p>She lowers her voice to a near whisper, her breath hot and stale on your faces. "She can be... persuasive. She can weave illusions that make you see what she wants you to see, hear what she wants you to hear. She can whisper promises of peace and protection, but those promises are built on stagnation, on decay. She wants to keep you here, trapped in her little world of unchanging green, forever bound to her will."</p>
<p>She pauses, letting the weight of her words sink in. "So if you find yourself deep in the heart of the woods, and the trees seem to be watchin' you, and the air grows heavy with the scent of damp earth and old leaves... be careful. Be very careful. Because Bloodmoon... she's not just a guardian. She's a jailer. And she don't take kindly to those who try to escape her embrace."</p>

Over the course of two years, while living as a tongueless, dyslexic slug, she mastered the language, even proposing the renaming of Sylvan to "Olde Elvish" based on her groundbreaking research into its origins. Her magnum opus, the "Ox-Fur Elvish Dictionary" (OED), remains a cornerstone of linguistic scholarship.</p>

<figcaption>Warhammer of Stonebridge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Legend has it that the Warhammer of Stonebridge was forged by a legendary dwarven smith for King MacGuffin, the founder of the dwarven settlement of Stonebridge. Imbued with powerful magic, the hammer played a pivotal role in King MacGuffin's victories against savage troll hordes, solidifying Stonebridge's place as a bastion of dwarven strength and resilience.</p>
<p>However, whispers persist of a dark bargain struck during the hammer's creation. It is rumored that the smith, desperate to aid his king and ensure the prosperity of his people, made a pact with a powerful hag. The hammer would suppress a genetic stutter that plagued the MacGuffin royal line, but at a cost. While the hammer granted King MacGuffin and his descendants immense power and military success, the true cost of this bargain remains a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p>For generations, the Warhammer of Stonebridge has remained within the royal family of Stonebridge, passed down from king to heir. It is currently wielded by King Gillibran, the current ruler of Stonebridge and grandson of the legendary King MacGuffin.</p>

<h3>Letter of Writ</h3>

<p>Your counsel is sorely needed. I trust you will receive him with your customary grace and lend him your ear.</p>

<p>Loyal to the Forest: Deeply connected to the natural world, Sugarplum is a fierce protector of the forest. He views it as his home and will defend it against any threat, however minor.</p>
<p>Loves Gossip and News: He has a voracious appetite for news, using this information to help others, warn them of danger, or connect them with those who can assist them.</p>
<p>Homebody: Despite his adventurous spirit within the forest, he is deeply rooted to his home and becomes uncomfortable venturing far from its borders, especially crossing significant natural barriers. He prefers the familiar sights, sounds, and smells of his territory.</p>
<p>Playful and Mischievous: Sugarplum is inherently playful and mischievous, constantly seeking opportunities to tease, trick, or surprise others. He enjoys playing harmless pranks on unsuspecting creatures, often leaving behind a trail of illusory butterflies or a cascade of falling leaves.</p>
<p>Curious and Inquisitive: With his boundless energy, Sugarplum is always exploring, always seeking out new sights and sounds. He's fascinated by the world around him and never tires of discovering new wonders.</p>

<p>Wings: Delicate and translucent, like stained glass, a lighter shade of yellow with intricate patterns of darker yellow veins.

<p>Grin: A wide, almost unnervingly broad smile that stretches from ear to ear, revealing rows of tiny, needle-sharp teeth. It's a grin of pure, unrestrained glee, making him look slightly "insane" when he's happy.</p>
<p>Movement: Darting and diving through the air with acrobatic grace.</p>
<p>Sound: A soft, buzzing hum from his wings, and a high-pitched, tinkling laughter like wind chimes made of glass.</p>

<h3>Vicissitude (Sissy) Wormwood</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Green Hag, Neutral Evil</p>
<h4>Personality</h4>
<p>Twisted Idealism (Vicissitude-Driven): This is the foundation. She genuinely believes in a distorted philosophy where unwelcome change (vicissitude) is essential for growth and balance. This justifies her cruel actions in her own mind.</p>
<p>Detached Cruelty (Lack of Empathy): She is profoundly lacking in empathy, viewing pain as an abstract concept necessary for her warped vision of balance, rather than the lived experience of others. This detachment allows her to inflict suffering without remorse.</p>
<p>Manipulative and Cryptic Communication: She prefers indirect methods, manipulating events and using cryptic language (riddles, metaphors, proverbs). This reflects her distorted perception of reality and adds to her unsettling nature.</p>
<p>Arrogant Sense of Superiority (Distorted Self-Perception): She is utterly convinced of the rightness of her philosophy and her role as an agent of vicissitude. This manifests as arrogance and a dismissal of opposing viewpoints.</p>
<p>Distorted Emulation of a Higher Power (Facsimile of Fate): She acts as a distorted reflection of the Fates, believing she controls destiny and orchestrates the flow of fortune. This delusion of grandeur fuels her actions.</p>
<p>Childlike Simplicity and Unpredictability: Her understanding of complex concepts is simplistic, reflected in her language and behavior. She can shift abruptly between childlike innocence and chilling rage. This adds to her unsettling and unpredictable nature.</p>
<p>Obsessed with Change/Vicissitude (Rigid Adherence to a Distorted Ideal): She is fixated on constant change, viewing it as essential for preventing stagnation. This obsession has become rigid and dogmatic, blinding her to the true consequences of her actions.</p>
<p>Macabre Fascination with Decay and Suffering: She is drawn to images of decay, wounds, and death, seeing them as evidence of the natural cycle of destruction and renewal. This fascination is reflected in her appearance, pronouncements, and the "lessons" she orchestrates.</p>
<h4>Appearance</h4>
<figure>
<img src="26a-sissy.jpeg" class="storyboard"/>
<figcaption>Sissy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Skin: Sickly grey-green, like stagnant pond water or decaying foliage. Stretched taut over bone, giving her a gaunt, almost skeletal appearance in some areas.</p>
<p>Thorny Protrusions: Sharp, thorny outgrowths erupt from her skin, like cruel barbs or hastily drawn spikes. These are not uniform but clustered in patches, perhaps along her back, shoulders, and forearms. Some might even pierce through her clothing.</p>
<p>Weeping Sores: Open sores mar her flesh, oozing a viscous, iridescent fluid that catches the light in an unsettling way. These sores vary in size and appearance, some small and weeping, others larger and more ulcerous. They attract swarms of buzzing flies, adding to the sense of decay.</p>
<p>Face: In stark contrast to the rest of her body, her face possesses an unsettling beauty.</p>
<p>High Cheekbones: Prominent cheekbones give her face a sharp, almost angular appearance.</p>
<p>Delicate Features: Despite the overall grotesque nature of her form, her nose, lips, and chin are delicately shaped, hinting at a former beauty now corrupted.</p>
<p>Milky White Eyes: Her eyes are completely white, lacking pupils or irises. They stare blankly ahead, giving the impression that she is looking through you or at something unseen. They rarely blink, adding to the unsettling effect.</p>
<p>Hair: Greasy and grey, often matted and tangled. It might be streaked with dirt or bits of decaying leaves and twigs.</p>
<p>Headpiece: A gaudy, colorful fascinator sits askew on her head. It's adorned with:</p>
<p>Wilting Flowers: The flowers are past their prime, their petals drooping and browning.</p>
<p>Iridescent Insect Wings: These could be dragonfly wings, butterfly wings, or the wings of some other large insect, adding a touch of otherworldly beauty to the macabre headpiece.</p>
<p>Attire: Tattered black gothic clothing, clinging to her Reubenesque (full-figured) form. The fabric is torn and frayed in places, revealing glimpses of her grotesque skin beneath. A black crocheted shawl, resembling spider silk, might be draped over her shoulders.</p>
<p>Limbs: Four powerful, corded arms extend from her torso. They are muscular and sinewy, ending in wickedly sharp claws that are stained with grime and dried blood. These claws are capable of both delicate manipulation and brutal force.</p>
<p>Overall Impression: The overall impression is one of unsettling contrast: beauty and decay, human and monstrous, natural and unnatural. She is a grotesque parody of life and death intertwined.</p>
<h4>World View</h4>
<p>Gillibran (Dwarf King): Sissy views Gillibran with a mixture of pity and contempt. She sees him as weak and dependent on the warhammer, unable to face the true challenges necessary for growth. She might see him as a spoiled child clinging to a toy, preventing him and his people from maturing. She may even have a twisted sort of "tough love" for him, believing that taking the hammer away is ultimately in his best interest.</p>
<p>MacGuffin (Gillibran's Grandfather): Sissy has a more complex view of MacGuffin. She may have respected him for his initial reliance on her during Stonebridge's founding, seeing it as an acknowledgment of her power. However, she now sees his legacy as a source of weakness for his descendants, creating a dependency she seeks to break. She might even feel betrayed by MacGuffin's eventual rejection of her influence.</p>
<p>Bloodmoon (Dryad): Sissy sees Bloodmoon as a sentimental fool, clinging to the past and hindering true progress. She views Bloodmoon's protectiveness of the forest as stifling new growth, preventing the natural cycle of decay and rebirth. Sissy might see Bloodmoon as a direct obstacle to her plans, a force of stagnation that must be overcome. She may also see Bloodmoon as a rival for influence over the natural world, a challenge to her self-proclaimed role as an agent of balance.</p>
<p>Sugarplum (Faerie Dragon): Sissy views Sugarplum as a chaotic pest, a disruptive element that interferes with her carefully orchestrated plans. She finds his whimsical nature and unpredictable actions irritating and frustrating. His magical abilities, especially his illusions and misdirection, make him difficult to control or predict. She also resents his amulet, which makes him hard to track.</p>
<p>Yaztromo (Archmage): Sissy views Yaztromo with a mixture of grudging respect, irritation, and amusement. She respects his power and understanding of the world but sees him as a predictable obstacle to her plans. She enjoys the challenge of outmaneuvering him, seeing him as a worthy opponent in her twisted game.</p>
<p>The Warhammer: The warhammer is the focal point of Sissy's current machinations. She sees it as a symbol of the dwarves' dependence and a disruption of the natural balance between them and the trolls. Removing the hammer is her primary goal.</p>
<p>Darkwood Forest: Sissy feels a deep connection to Darkwood, believing it speaks to her and guides her actions. She sees the forest as a reflection of her own philosophy, a place of constant change, decay, and rebirth. She may consider herself a guardian of the forest in a twisted way, protecting it from stagnation and ensuring its continued cycle of vicissitude.</p>
<p>Stonebridge (Dwarf Settlement): Sissy sees Stonebridge as a symbol of stagnation, a place where the dwarves have become too comfortable and complacent. She believes they need to be shaken from their complacency to grow stronger. She may even see the destruction of Stonebridge as a necessary part of restoring balance.</p>
<h4>Lair</h4>
<p>1. The Perverted Guest Parlour:</p>
<p>The Hollow Log: The main entrance leads into a large, hollow log that serves as Sissy's guest parlor. The interior is surprisingly spacious, though cluttered with strange objects, creating a sense of claustrophobia despite the size.</p>
<p>Ominous Decorations: Instead of welcoming decorations, the parlour is adorned with a disturbing collection of macabre items: animal skulls (some with strange symbols carved into them), bones (arranged in unsettling patterns), dried flowers (many of them poisonous or associated with death), insect wings (pinned to the walls like morbid butterflies), and other natural curiosities (preserved insects in amber, strangely shaped stones, etc.). These are not simply scattered but arranged with a disturbing sense of purpose, reflecting Sissy's twisted philosophy.</p>
<p>The Hearth: A small fire burns constantly in a hearth formed by twisted roots, casting flickering shadows that dance across the walls and exaggerate the grotesque decorations. The smoke from the fire has a strange, acrid smell, like burning herbs and decaying leaves.</p>
<p>Seating Area: Instead of comfortable furniture, a small seating area is arranged around a low, gnarled table. This area consists of several uncomfortable-looking stools made from twisted branches and a larger, more ornate chair made from woven vines and adorned with feathers, bones, and tufts of animal fur. The chair looks almost like a grotesque throne.</p>
<p>2. The Back Office Swamp:</p>
<p>A Hidden Passage: A narrow passage near the seating area, concealed by hanging moss and woven vines, leads into a hidden swamp within the hollow log. The air here is instantly thicker, heavy with moisture and the cloying smell of decay and stagnant water.</p>
<p>The Magical Loom: In the center of the swamp stands a large, rickety loom made from twisted branches and vines, its frame draped with decaying cloth and strands of what appear to be human hair. It is here that Sissy weaves her macabre creations, using entrails, hair, bones, and other gruesome materials.</p>
<p>The Gulthias Plants: Patches of gulthias plants grow in the swamp, their dark, twisted branches and deep purple/black leaves adding to the oppressive atmosphere. They seem to thrive in the damp, decaying environment.</p>
<p>Murky Pools: Small pools of murky water dot the swamp, reflecting the dim light and casting eerie, distorted reflections. Strange rustling and bubbling sounds emanate from beneath the surface, suggesting unseen creatures lurking within.</p>
<p>The Nursery (Currently Empty): Deeper within the swamp, partially obscured by hanging moss and twisting vines, is a small, enclosed area that clearly served as a nursery. It's a disturbing sight: tiny cradles woven from thorny branches and lined with decaying moss, miniature versions of Sissy's own macabre decorations, and small, crudely made toys crafted from bones and feathers lie scattered on the damp earth. The air here is particularly still and heavy, imbued with a palpable sense of loss and emptiness.</p>
<p>3. The Kitchen Garden:</p>
<p>The Entrance: A small, arched doorway leads from the guest parlor to the kitchen garden. The doorway is overgrown with moss and vines, making it difficult to see beyond.</p>
<p>The Garden Itself: The garden is enclosed by a wattle fence made from twisted branches and thorny vines. Inside the fence is a raised bed filled with a variety of plants. These plants are not typical vegetables or herbs, but rather strange, twisted growths that resemble mutated flowers, gnarled roots, and thorny vines. The plants are arranged in a seemingly random pattern, but there is an underlying sense of purpose and intention.</p>
<p>The Scarecrow: Standing in the center of the garden is a scarecrow made from dried twigs, ragged cloth, and a pumpkin head. However, this is no ordinary scarecrow. Its eyes seem to follow you as you move, and its mouth twists into a sinister grin. There is something unsettling about the scarecrow, as if it is more than just a simple decoration.</p>
