The Maze Beneath the Trees
The Forest of Falsehoods
A Journey Through the Loom


Lost in a maze of trees and lies, can you see through the veils of illusion, discern friend from foe, and recover the shattered Dwarven Warhammer to save Stonebridge from ruin?




Bigleg's murder reveals a deadly threat to the dwarven settlement of Stonebridge. Driven by clues, the heroes race to find the wizard Yastromo, Stonebridge's only hope for survival.

Following Bigleg's clue, the heroes seek Yaztromo, only to be ambushed by Sissy, the malevolent hag. Disguised as Boomer the centaur, she attempts to thwart them, but failing that, she transforms into the terrifying dryad Bloodmoon, cursing the heroes with her chilling magic.

Lost and cursed, the heroes face an impossible quest. Their only hope lies with the enigmatic Yaztromo, but he reveals a devastating truth: the legendary warhammer they seek is shattered, its pieces scattered across the treacherous Darkwood Forest.

Trapped in a hostile forest, the heroes face relentless attacks from awakened plants. Their search for the warhammer and a cure for their curse yields nothing, leaving them weakened and desperate.

Sissy, the cunning hag, weaves a web of deceit. She warns of a malevolent witch (Bloodmoon) and a fearsome dragon (Sugarplum), while secretly misdirecting the heroes from the shattered warhammer. Inexperienced and desperate, the heroes become lost in a maze of lies.

Sugarplum's infuriating antics strain the heroes' patience. Yet, Sugarplum holds the key to their success. Recognizing her potential, they must navigate this volatile alliance if they hope to overcome the dangers ahead.

The heroes use brain and brawn to wrest the warhammer handle from the clutches of an ogre in its lair.

Bidding farewell to Sugarplum, the heroes, with trepidation, face the unknown dangers of the northern Darkwood Forest as they cross the churning Catfish River.

Cursed and weakened, the exhausted heroes struggle to find respite by the rushing Catfish River. Their fragile peace is shattered by a horrifying night assault. Twig Blights swarm from the darkness, followed by a Giant Spider. The heroes, fighting for their lives, must overcome their injuries and the growing threat to survive.

Engulfed by a raging landslide in the treacherous hills of Darkwood, the cursed heroes fight for survival, their quest shattered as the precious warhammer handle vanishes beneath the rubble.

Haunted by Sissy's lies, the heroes fear facing Bloodmoon. Overcoming their doubts, they seek her aid to recover the missing Warhammer head and break their curses.

Following Bloodmoon's cryptic clues, descend into an eerie crypt. There, amidst the bones of the long dead, they face a horde of undead ghouls in a desperate struggle to recover the missing head of the legendary warhammer.

Ambushed by ruthless dark elves in Darkwood, the heroes face a grim choice: fight for survival, risking their lives and the precious Warhammer halves, or bargain with their cunning captors.

The weary heroes face a helpful dwarf. Though suspicious, they're tempted to trust him with the hammer pieces. Can they overcome Sissy's deceit and save Stonebridge?

Triumphant, the heroes return to Stonebridge, welcomed by cheering crowds. The shadow of Sissy's curse lifts as gratitude and hope abound. A renowned healer offers to cure them, and a brighter future beckons as the heroes embrace their newfound acclaim.
